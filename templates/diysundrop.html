            <p>If you’re not here for an explanation of the DiY Sundrop method, it comes down to this: prime in black, dry brush on the 
            darkest color, dry brush on a lighter color, then one last layer of dry brush in the lightest color. Simple and easy; in and out
             in less than five minutes per mini (minus primer drying time). Otherwise let’s begin.</p>
            <br>
            <strong>Required Materials</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>2 Paintbrushes (One is the dedicated Primer brush)</li>
                <li>Black Primer (Can be substituted with black acrylic paint, see update)</li>
                <li>Three colors (explained below)</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Protective Spray</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="smallcenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/materials.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/materials.jpg') }}"></a><a> (I hope I don't get paint on my boxes...)</a></div><br>

              <strong>Introduction</strong>
              <br>
              <p>It’s been <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/awakenrealms/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon/posts/2370273">
              confirmed by Awaken Realms</a> that the official Sundrop method uses washes, which we will <strong>not</strong> being employing.
               Washes tend to be expensive as well as complicate the painting process. Instead we will be employing dry brushing on black primer,
                anywhere between two to four (or more if you prefer) layers of dry brush to simulate the Sundrop effect. </p>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/comparison23.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/comparison23.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                The official Sundrop is on the right on both photos, wash is noticeable but is it worth the trouble and money?</a></div><br>
              <p>This is an extremely fast and efficient way of painting minis. It’s become my default for when I don’t have the time or patience to paint tons of miniatures. For example, the as of yet 
              unreleased <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameaccessory/314498/oathsworn-deepwood-armory">Oathsworn contains the Armory box,</a>
               which has tons of little weapons. I will be employing this DiY Sundrop technique
               to Oathsworn when I receive it (as well as Nemesis, Vanguard, Great Wall...) as painting those normally would be very difficult and time consuming. </p>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/othersundrop.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/othersundrop.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Blood Rage on the left, Wasteland Express on the right. All done using the same method!</a></div><br>
                <p>This method also creates a great <strong>base coat</strong>, ready to be painted on if you decide to go with more details:</p>
                <div class="smallcenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/bloodrage/6.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/bloodrage/6.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                DiY Sundrop result, just add a few more colors!</a></div><br>
                <strong>Color Selection</strong>
                <p>This guide will use Tainted Grail as an example but again, this method can be used on any game. The only difference is 
                the colors you use. The colors you pick all should be somewhat close to each other. In our example I’m trying to emulate 
                the official Tainted Grail Sundrops, which look like a mix of brown and beige.  So I chose a darker brown, a lighter brown 
                and an off white. The darkest color should be your first coat of paint. Then <strong>every subsequent layer should be lighter in tone</strong>. 
                Note that my off white isn’t going to be directly applied; it will be mixed with my other browns to lighten them up. Getting 
                a lighter tone of a color is easily done by mixing that color with white or a brighter color:</p>

                All that's needed</a></div><br>

                <p>For this tutorial we will be painting these nice fellows:</p>

                <strong>I. Priming your Mini</strong>
                <p><strong>UPDATE (Jan 21st, 2021):</strong> You can substitute black primer with black paint if you wish, see photos at bottom of page for comparison.</p>
                <p>If you haven’t designated a permanent primer brush I recommend doing so. Primer is thick and will ruin your brushes 
                in the long run. It should be a smaller brush so you can get into crevices, but a large brush will save time on larger minis.
                 Do both if you have enough brushes!</p>
                 <div class="smallcenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step1.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step1.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Spread and cover every millimeter in primer</a></div><br>
                <p>Wet your brush, apply primer to it and start painting your mini. You’ll probably have to stop half way through priming 
                as you’ll need dry places to hold the primer as you prime your mini 360°. Spread the primer out as fully as you can, you 
                don’t want it bunched up. A little bunching is OK since primer will dry. Some crevices are very difficult to spread thinly as
                 your brush may be too big, but as long as you get the primer in there, even bunched up primer should dry fine. When youre 
                 waiting for your primer to dry, be sure to clean your brushes under the sink to prolong their life. Primer will glue your
                 bristles together!</p>
                 <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step12.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step12.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                The left photo shows primer bunching, the right photo should be the end result after you spread thoroughly with your brush</a></div><br>
                <div class="smallcenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step13.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step13.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                A small paint brush will save your sanity in crevices like here</a></div><br>
                <p>Double check all crevices for easily missed spots. Change your room’s lighting if you need to get a better view. Wait for 
                your figure to fully dry before taking the next step. The drying in between can take anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
                 <div class="smallcenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step14.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step14.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Missed a spot</a></div><br>
                
                <strong>II. Dry brushing the first layer</strong>
                <p>Dry brushing is a technique which involves a dry paint brush with a minimal amount of paint, applied to the miniature in a <strong>quick smothering 
                like motion</strong>. The motion is similar to <a href="https://youtu.be/KM971KEFVco?t=52">when Bob Ross use to “beat the devil” out of his brushes. </a></p>
                <p>Pour out your darkest color. For me it was this dark brown which ended being too dark so I mixed in some off white to lighten it up. Thoroughly mix 
                to get one color.</p>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step21.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step21.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Delicious.</a></div><br>
                <p>Dip the tip of your second, <strong>dry</strong> paintbrush in, making sure to cover the tips of all the bristles. I like using a larger brush here since the larger size
                 helps spread paint more efficiently. Now run your brush along a paper towel or newspaper to remove excess paint. 
                The rule of thumb with dry brushing is that when you <strong> wipe your paintbrush across a paper towel and you still see paint being painted on the towel, there is still too much paint on the brush. </strong> 
                This step is 
                extremely important as too much paint will cause your mini to not come out right. I would say over 90% of the paint should be off the 
                brush when you're removing paint from your dry brush. Also when running your brush across your paper towel, brush in all directions!
                I can almost guarantee there will be pockets of paint that are hidden and you want those removed! </p>
                 <div class="smallcenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step22.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step22.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Keep wiping until your brush is barely making paint marks</a></div><br>
                <p> Now just apply the motion mentioned above to your mini. You want your <strong>swipes to be quick; back and forth</strong>.
                As a side note if you haven’t used  a color or brand of paint before, I suggest you paint a small amount on your 
                brush and apply to the figure just to see how it looks. In general painting on top of a dark base will produce a darker 
                layer on top. Another issue you may have is your paint not sticking at all:</p> 
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step23.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step23.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                2 examples of this brand of paint not sticking, those photos were taken after applying paint!</a></div><br>
                <p>When your paint works correctly, you will see an immediate effect:</p>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step24.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step24.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                <strong>All the details should pop out immediately</strong>. Note the shield in photo 2, a sign of too much paint</a></div><br>
                <p>You can see above the mini brightens up and all the detail start to come through. Look out for what happened
                in the second photo which is too much paint. Your dry brushing should result in a light coat of paint hitting all the details
                and crevices. Photo two is an indication that not enough paint was removed from the brush 
                during the previous step. You can try wiping the paint off your mini if this happens, or in more extreme circumstances, wipe off the paint with something wet. 
                You can accidentally remove your primer by doing this but no worries, just re-prime. Either way wait until your mini is dry before you try
                again. </p>
                <strong>III. Dry brushing the other layer(s)</strong>
                <p>From here on out you’re just dry brushing additional layers. <strong>Every layer will be lighter in tone than the one before. Every application
                of that paint will be applied to your mini in less time than before.</strong> For example if the first layer of dry brush was applied over 15 seconds, 
                the 2nd layer could by applied over 8 seconds, third layer would only be 5 seconds. Go by how it looks to determine the time. The number of layers 
                you want is up to you. Between two to four is good, I did three 
                for this figure. </p>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step3.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step3.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                More off-white to my paint from the layer before to get a lighter color. Get around 95% of the paint off before you dry brush the 2nd layer!</a></div><br>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step32.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step32.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                A second layer of dry brush applied, more lightly than the first layer and applied more quickly</a></div><br>
                <p>Seeing as the lighter brown hasn't been used at all, I figured to use him for the last layer so he wouldn't have his feelings hurt.
                Joking aside, it's good having different colors as that will create different subtle effects, so I encourage you try different colors rather
                than just using once color and adding white to lighten it for every layer. I again mixed with off white to bring the mixture 
                to a lighter color tone than the already applied paint. Here <strong>the dry brushing is extremely light and only hitting the most 
                outward parts of the mini</strong>. Weapons, foreheads, shoulders are almost always what you're aiming for as you get on your last layers.
                Thank of sunlight shining down. For me, the dry brushing applications at the last layer is barely a few swipes of the paintbrush.</p>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step33.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step33.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                A third and final layer of dry brush applied</a></div><br>
                <p>It may be hard to see in these photos the effects of each layer but I assure you makes a difference!</p>
                <strong>IV. Protective Spray</strong>
                <p>The last step is protecting your figure. Be outside or in a well-ventilated area. <strong>Give your spray can a good shake and be one foot to 
                two feet away from your mini and spray</strong>. Don’t spray too close or you figure will get glossy! This was a mistake I learned early on. 
                You may have to spray in layers if you can’t get 360° around your mini. I also recommend spraying in quick short bursts, this 
                will help you control how much spray is being applied as well as overspraying which will result in a glossy texture.
                Let the varnish dry before returning, rotating or flipping your 
                mini and spray again. </p>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step4.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/step4.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Be in a well-ventilated area, inhaling this stuff is probably bad for you</a></div><br><br>
                <div class="smallcenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/bloodrage/toomuch.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/bloodrage/toomuch.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Right guy's varnish applied badly. He looks like a swimmer</a></div><br>
                <p>Just like that you're done! It's still amazing how little work it takes to make an unpainted mini look decent.
                Once you have the technique down it just comes to color selection. For Nemesis for instance, i think dark blue or silver 
                might be good. Just experiment and have fun!
                </p>  
                <div class="smallcenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/unpaint.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/unpaint.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                </a></div><br>
                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/final1.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/final1.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Looks great!</a></div><br>
                 <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/final2.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/final2.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Comparison with the official Sundrop, just adjust the color to get closer to the original.</a></div><br>

                <strong>UPDATE (Jan 21st, 2021)</strong>
                <p> I decided to try black acrylic paint instead of black primer to see if there was any difference. </p>

                <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/black1.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/black1.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                Left: The dude we're testing on Right: The giant is black primer vs the guy in black paint. Giants's black is sightly duller </a></div><br>

                 <div class="twocenterpage"> <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/black2.jpg') }}" Data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sundrop/black2.jpg') }}"></a><a>
                The finished product, no major differences between this and primer as base</a></div><br>

                <p> My conclusion? I didn't notice any major differences, substitute away. Keep in mind though black primer does have other uses where
                black acrylic paint may not be able to substitute, but for this example it would appear fine. I'll update if I notice
                anything different with the figure as time passes.</p>
